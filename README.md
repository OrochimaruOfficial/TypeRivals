--> While working on TypeRivals, I encountered several challenges that hindered the full implementation of planned features:

Firestore Integration:

I aimed to store and retrieve user data (e.g., statistics, history, leaderboard) using Firebase Firestore. However, due to time constraints and implementation difficulties, I couldnâ€™t fully integrate Firestore functionality into the dashboard and leaderboard features.

Gemini API Integration:

The plan was to leverage the Gemini API for advanced typing test features. Unfortunately, despite trying several approaches, I was unable to successfully integrate it into the project.

Time Constraints:

Balancing development time with debugging and testing made it challenging to implement all intended features effectively.




Ensure you have internet connectivity for Firebase integration to work.
